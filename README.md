# Number Guessing Game

### Description
I used Python to build a simple number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number and the user has to guess it. The user will be given a limited number of chances to guess the number. If the user guesses the number correctly, the game will end, and the user will win. Otherwise, the game will continue until the user runs out of chances.

### How to Run
Clone the Repository:
```bash
gh repo clone cgrustas/Number-Guessing-Game
```
    
### How to Play
1. Select a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard), which will determine the number of chances you receive to guess the random number
2. Enter your guess.
3. If your guess is incorrect, you will receive a hint indicating whether your guess was higher or lower than the random number.
4. Keep guessing until you guess the correct number or run out of attempts.
